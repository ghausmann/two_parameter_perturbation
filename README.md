# two_parameter_perturbation
In this repository you will find the replication files from the working paper "Solving open-economy models with incomplete markets by perturbation", by Guillermo Hausmann-Guil (2024). 
Each folder comes with a readme ".txt" file that lists the files and provides instructions. 
The folder "Perturbation" consists of the solution package by Levintal (2017), which comes with its own license. 
You are welcome to use these files for your own research. Just remember to give credit to the source!

NOTE: The repository is still in contruction. What's missing? the files to solve the two-country DSGE model with the package by Levintal (currently only with Dynare), the example solving the stochastic growth model, and the files to implement pruning treating perturbation variables as parameters.
