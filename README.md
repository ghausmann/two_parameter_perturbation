# two_parameter_perturbation
In this repository you will find the replication files from the working paper "Solving open-economy models with incomplete markets by perturbation", by Guillermo Hausmann-Guil (2024). 
Each folder comes with a readme ".txt" file that lists the files and provides instructions. 
The folder "Perturbation" consists of the solution package by Levintal (2017), which comes with its own license. 
Advice: Levintal's package and Dynare's routines do not get along too well.. Thus, I recommend to stick to one of them within each Matlab session. 
Please write to guillermo.hausmann@evaf.vu.lt if you find any issue.
You are welcome to use these files for your own research. Just remember to give credit to the sources!
