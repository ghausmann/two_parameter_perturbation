# two_parameter_perturbation
In this repository you will find the replication files from the paper "Solving DSGE models with incomplete markets by perturbation", by Guillermo Hausmann-Guil.

I solve most of the applications with both Dynare (5.x version) and the solution package by Levintal (2017), so you can visualize codes in parallel and learn how to use one toolkit from the other. Also note that there's always 100% agreement between codes using either toolkit.   
 
Each folder comes with a readme ".txt" file that lists the files and provides instructions.  
 
The folder "Perturbation" consists of the solution package by Levintal (2017), which comes with its own license.
 

Advice: If you change from Levintal's package to Dynare's routines (or viceversa), remember to remove the corresponding folders with codes from the MATLAB search path, as otherwise the packages may conflict with each other.  
 
Please write to guillermo.hausmann@evaf.vu.lt if you find any issue.  

You are welcome to use these files for your own research. Just remember to give credit to the sources!
