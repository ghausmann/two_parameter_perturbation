# two_parameter_perturbation
In this repository you will find the replication files from the working paper "Solving DSGE models with incomplete markets by perturbation", by Guillermo Hausmann-Guil (2024). 
Each folder comes with a readme ".txt" file that lists the files and provides instructions. 
The folder "Perturbation" consists of the solution package by Levintal (2017), which comes with its own license. 
Advice: If you change from Levintal's package to Dynare's routines (or viceversa), remember to remove the corresponding folders with codes from the MATLAB search path, as otherwise the packages may conflict with each other. 
Please write to guillermo.hausmann@evaf.vu.lt if you find any issue.
You are welcome to use these files for your own research. Just remember to give credit to the sources!
NEW! Revised version with codes to solve the Devereux and Sutherland (2011) model, portfolio dynamics included.
