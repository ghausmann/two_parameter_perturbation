These codes replicate the results from Appendix A (Devereux and Sutherland model) using Levintal's toolkit.

The 5 current codes in this folder are:

prepare_model_ds_wealth_5p.m: script, performs the pre-processing of the DS model, using the original notation by DS.

eval_sss_ds_wealth_5p.m: evaluation function to implement the SSS algorithm.
compute_sss_wealth_ds_5p.m: function to approximate the SSS

solution_ds_compstats_wealth_5p.m: script, replicates Figure 1, panel (a) in Appendix A.
solution_ds_irfs_wealth_5p.m: script, replicates Figure 1, panel (b) in Appendix A.

INSTRUCTIONS: 
- Add the folders "Perturbation" (folder and subfolders) and "common functions" to the Matlab path.
- Run the script prepare_model_ds_wealth_5p.m once.
