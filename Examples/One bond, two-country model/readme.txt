Codes to solve the one-bond, two-country model of Appendix D.4, using Levintal's package.
The 7 current codes in this folder are:

prepare_mode_bond2.m: script, pre-processing of the model
solution_bond2.m: script, replicates Figure 5 in Appendix D.4

eval_sss_bond2.m: function, evaluates SSS condition
calib_sss_bond2.m: function, evaluates SSS condition in calibration mode
compute_sss_bond2.m: function, implements SSS algorithm
compute_calib_bond2.m: function, implements SSS algorithm in calibration mode
euler_errors_bond2.m: function, computes Euler errors

INSTRUCTIONS: add the folders "Perturbation" and "common functions" to MATLAB's search path, and run "prepare_mode_bond2.m" once.
